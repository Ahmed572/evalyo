# EVALYO APP

###*Find your next professor, the right way.*

## A Common Problem

Students at Hunter College often use Rate My Professors to choose their courses. The site gives them ratings and reviews written by former students about professor. That way, a student can choose if the professor whether to pick a professor based on a rating or not.

The problem with Rate My Professors is that it's a haven for disgruntled students to let their frustrations out from a previous experience with professors. The site is filled with sour and often harsh comments. Professors avoid the site due to its well-known student abuse.

This is not to say that professors shy away from reviews by students. In fact, every semester they ask students to submit course evaluations, which are entered in a database for faculty and students.

Technically, students could rely on the information from this database instead of the one provided in Rate My Professors. There are more reviews of Hunter Students in this site than Rate My Professors, providing a degree of historical statistical accuracy. Also this site does not include comments so it doesn't contain the abuse of Rate My Professors.

However, the problem with this database solution is that the information is not aggregated neither by professor, course, or semester, leaving more to be desired from a user experience. The site could use a redesign with the student in mind.

## Evalyo - Great for Students and Fair for Professors

A team of Students at Hunter College is envisioning a web application to view professors ratings. In theory, it would use the current Hunter College course evaluation database, and present it in a student-friendly manner. Among its features:

1. **Professor Based Querying:** Instead of receiving a list of courses with a professor that matches your result, professor queries will aggregate the courses to a single professor. Also, another feature would show when a professor which semester a professor teacher a course (spring, summer, fall, winter, etc).

2. **Historical Aggregation:** Students will be able to see a professors rating across multiple semesters, the number will be in a total average that weights recent semesters more heavily.

3. **Class Based Querying:** Unlike Rate my Professors or the current Hunter Based System, students could search based on courses and see results of all professors who've taught the course.

4. **Student Friendly Language:** Current data presents information with an obtuse language. The app would reduce metrics from a total of 20+ to five key metrics.

5. **Feature Friendly:** With the historical data, the sky is the limit in the way we present information.

## Technologies

Our team is going to the web framework, REACT (made by Facebook), to present the app with modern design in mind. Moreover, we would use a relational database known as MongoDB that would allow for more intrepid means to present the data.

## Goals

By contributing the teacher evaluation data, we can create an application that could be used by hundreds of students. Instead of using application that lead to abuse such as Rate My Professors, students can use the evaluation that their peers wrote. Teachers already use those evaluations so it's just a matter about how the information is presented to the students.

The app can serve as a prototype for the College to pursue a more complete project. Also the value of saving thousands of dollars in an application beneficial for both faculty and the student population.

The college can be assured that this project would only be for learning purposes and will not be distributed without the approval of the college.
