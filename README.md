# EVALYO APP

Find your next professor, the right way.

## A Common Problem

Students at Hunter College use sites like Rate My Professors to select a course. Students may want to know professors who teach a course.

The problem with Rate My Professors is that it's a haven for disgruntled student to let their frustrations from an experience with professors. Harsh comments fill the site. And professor avoid the site due to student abuse.

However professors arguably welcome review by students. Every semester they ask students to submit course evaluation, which are entered in a database for faculty and students.

Technically, students could rely on the information from this database instead of the one provided in Rate My Professors. However, information is not aggregated neither by professor, course, or semester, leaving more to be desired from a user perspective.

## Evalyo - Great for Students and Fair for Professors

A team of Students at Hunter College is envisioning a web application to view professors ratings. In theory, it would use the current Hunter College course evaluation database, and present it in a student-friendly manner. Among its features:

1. **Professor Based Querying:** Instead of receiving a list of courses with a professor that matches your result, professor queries will aggregate the courses to a single professor. Also, another feature would show when a professor which semester a professor teacher a course (spring, summer, fall, winter, etc).

2. **Historical Aggregation:** Students will be able to see a professors rating across multiple semesters, the number will be in a total average that weights recent semesters more heavily.

3. **Class Based Querying:** Unlike Rate my Professors or the current Hunter Based System, students could search based on courses and see results of all professors who've taught the course.

4. **Student Friendly Language:** Current data presents information with an obtuse language. The app would reduce metrics from a total of 20+ to five key metrics.

5. **Feature Friendly:** With the historical data, the sky is the limit in the way we present information.

## Technologies

Our team is going to the modern web framework, REACT (made by Facebook), to present the app with modern design in mind.

## Goals

By contributing the teacher evaluation data, we can create an application that could be used by hundreds of students. The app can serve as a prototype for the College to pursue a more complete project. Also the value of saving thousands of dollars in an application beneficial for both faculty and the student population.
