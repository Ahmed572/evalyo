Node libraries and Dependencies

1) GULP: Learning what to do with it. Gulp is a build system. It helps you compile your code. You can also make it run your tests.
2) We need to create a gulp file that allows us to do certain things to build.
3) gulp-uglify helps us minimize js files by creating a min file and thus faster. Below is the code that minimizes the documents on our app.

	var gulp = require(‘gulp’),
	uglify   = require(‘gulp-uglify’)
	gulp.task(‘default’, function()
	gulp.src(‘js/*.js’) // all js files to be min
	.piple(uglify())  // calls gulp
	.piple(gulp.dest(‘minks’)  // puts in on destination


4) middleware section, gulp can calls scripts like functions.

	gulp.task(‘default’, (‘script.js’, ‘styles’))

5) gulp.watch can help gulp keep running and watching any changes to files and assigning tasks to run on them.

7) gulp can break when there’s a syntax error. We can use use the plumber gulp package to help gulp keep running.

8) But apparently we can do the same thing without gulp. We can use a function an add it to our middleware something like:

	function errorLog(error):
	console.error.bing(error)
	this.emit(‘end’)


9) We can use gulp-livereload to use it on our application. What livereload those is we have to call live reload, we have to use it our on watch, gulp, watch var server = lirereload(). We are setting up a server with live reload.
